In this program, we first define the list of tuples l. Then we use the map function to iterate over the list of integer values [34357, 25534] and apply a lambda function to each value. The lambda function takes an integer value a as input and returns a tuple that contains all the tuples from the original list l that have a second element equal to a.

We use the filter function inside the lambda function to select only the tuples that satisfy the given condition. The filter function takes a lambda function as its first argument that checks whether a given tuple has a second element equal to the input integer value a. The filter function returns an iterator that contains all the tuples that satisfy the condition.
