Intelligence is a complex concept that refers to the ability of an individual 
to learn from experience, reason, solve problems, adapt to new situations, and think abstractly.
While there is no universally agreed upon definition of intelligence, most experts agree that it is a multifaceted
construct that includes cognitive, social, and emotional abilities.
There are different ways to classify intelligence, but one common way is to distinguish between two broad types: 
fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence.

Fluid Intelligence: Fluid intelligence refers to the ability to think abstractly and solve problems in novel situations,
independent of acquired knowledge. It is often considered to be a measure of raw intellectual potential and is thought to
decline with age. Examples of tasks that measure fluid intelligence include pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and logical thinking.
