    "# 1)A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes\n",
    "# and methods that are common to all objects of that class. A class defines the behavior and properties \n",
    "# of a certain type of object.\n",
    "# 2) An object is an instance of a class. Objects are created based on the class definition and each object\n",
    "# created from a class has its own unique attributes and behavior. An object represents a real-world entity,\n",
    "# such as a person, a car, or a bank account.\n",
