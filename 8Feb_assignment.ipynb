    "Ans->No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly in Python. An abstract class is a class\n",
    "that defines the common interface for a set of related classes, but it cannot be instantiated on its own.\n",
    "Instead, you have to create a concrete subclass that implements the abstract methods defined in the abstract class,\n",

    "The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a blueprint for a set of related classes, to enforce a common interface for these classes,\n",
