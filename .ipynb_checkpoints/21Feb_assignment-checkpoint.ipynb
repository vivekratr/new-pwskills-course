    "Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "Ans->\n",
    "1) Web scraping, also known as web data extraction or web harvesting, is the process of extracting data from websites or web pages using automated software programs or tools. \n",
    "2) The extracted data can be saved in a structured format such as a CSV, Excel file, or database for further analysis.\n",
    "3) Web scraping is used for a variety of purposes, including:\n",
    "    a) Data Collection: Web scraping is commonly used to collect large amounts of data from websites, including product information, pricing, reviews, and customer feedback.\n",
    "    b) Research: Researchers often use web scraping to collect data for academic studies, such as social media analysis or sentiment analysis.\n",
    "    c) Marketing: Web scraping can be used to collect marketing-related data, such as email addresses, social media accounts, and other contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Three areas where web scraping is commonly used to get data are:\n",
    "    a) E-commerce: Retailers often use web scraping to monitor competitor prices, track product availability and pricing, and gather customer reviews and feedback.\n",
    "    b) Finance: Web scraping is used in the financial industry to collect market data, track stock prices, monitor news, and analyze trends.\n",
    "    c) Social Media: Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn are rich sources of data, and web scraping can be used to collect user data, sentiment analysis, and other related data."

    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "Ans-> \n",
    "1) Manual Scraping: \n",
    "    a) This involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a structured format such as a spreadsheet or database.\n",
    "    b) This method is time-consuming and not suitable for large-scale data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Web Scraping Tools:\n",
    "    a) Web scraping tools such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium automate the process of data extraction by parsing the HTML structure of a web page and extracting relevant information.\n",
    "    b) These tools can handle large volumes of data and are widely used in web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) API Scraping:\n",
    "    a) Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access their data in a structured format.\n",
    "    b) API scraping involves using these APIs to extract data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Data Service Providers:\n",
    "    a) Data service providers offer web scraping services that allow users to access large datasets of web scraped data.\n",
    "    b) These providers use automated tools to collect data from websites and provide access to this data through APIs or data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Browser Extensions:\n",
    "    a) Some browser extensions, such as Data Miner, allow users to extract data from web pages by selecting the data they want and exporting it to a structured format.\n",
    "    b) These extensions are easy to use and do not require any programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Machine Learning-based Scraping:\n",
    "    a) This method involves using machine learning algorithms to extract data from web pages automatically. \n",
    "    b) This approach is still in its early stages but shows great potential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of web scraping."

    "3) Beautiful Soup is widely used in web scraping due to its simplicity and ease of use.\n",
    "4) Beautiful Soup is used for the following reasons:\n",
    "    a) Beautiful Soup can parse HTML and XML documents, even if they are poorly formatted or incomplete, and extract the relevant data from them.\n",
    "    b) Beautiful Soup allows users to navigate the document tree and access specific elements, attributes, or tags within the document.\n",
    "    c) Beautiful Soup provides a range of methods for extracting data from HTML and XML documents. Users can extract data based on tags, attributes, class names, or even the text content of the document."

    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "Ans->\n",
    "1) Flask is a popular Python web framework used for building web applications.\n",
    "2) Flask is lightweight, flexible, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for building small to medium-sized web applications, including web scraping projects.\n",
    "3) Flask provides a routing system that allows developers to define URLs and map them to specific functions, making it easy to manage the different parts of a web scraping project.\n",
