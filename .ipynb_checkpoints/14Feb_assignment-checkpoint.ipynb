    "Q.1). What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "Ans->1) Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process.\n",
    "2) Each thread runs independently and can perform different tasks simultaneously, making it possible to improve the performance\n",
    "and efficiency of a program by utilizing the available resources more effectively.\n",
    "3) Multithreading is used in Python to execute time-consuming tasks in the background while keeping the user interface responsive,\n",
    "or to perform multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.\n",

    "Q.5 State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "Ans->Advantages:\n",
    "a) Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously,\n",
    "making use of available CPU resources.\n",
    "b) Responsiveness: Multithreading can help keep a program responsive by allowing long-running tasks to be executed in the background,\n",
    "while the main thread continues to process user input.\n",
    "c) Resource sharing: Multithreading allows multiple threads to share resources such as memory and files,\n",
    "which can reduce memory usage and increase efficiency.\n",
    "d) Modularity: Multithreading can make it easier to write modular code by separating different parts of the program into separate threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Complexity: Multithreading adds complexity to a program, which can make it harder to debug and maintain.\n",
    "It can also introduce race conditions and synchronization issues.\n",
    "b) Scalability: Multithreading can have diminishing returns as the number of threads increases.\n",
    "Adding more threads can increase overhead and contention, which can reduce performance.\n",
    "c) Deadlocks: Multithreading can lead to deadlocks, where two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources.\n",
    "This can cause the program to hang or crash."

    "Q.6 Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "Ans->1) Deadlocks:\n",
    "    a) A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources. \n",
    "    b) In other words, each thread is holding a resource that the other thread needs, and neither can proceed until the other releases the resource.\n",
    "    c) This can result in a situation where both threads are stuck and the program becomes unresponsive.\n",
    "2) Race conditions:\n",
    "    a) A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the timing of events, which can lead to unpredictable results.\n",
    "    b) Race conditions can occur when multiple threads access shared resources, such as variables or files, without proper synchronization.\n",
